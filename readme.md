## Kore 3

Kore is a low level toolkit for cross-platform game engine development and similar
endeavors. It is comparable to SDL but bigger in scope as it also takes care of
cross-platform GPU programming with multiple portable APIs to choose from and its
own shader language [Kongruent](https://github.com/Kode/Kongruent).

This is still in an experimental state and for now you might want to use Kore 2
instead.
